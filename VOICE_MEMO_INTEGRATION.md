# Voice Memo Integration Documentation

## Overview

This document explains the implementation of the enhanced voice memo functionality in the Adolat AI application. The new implementation provides users with the ability to record, play back, download, and save voice memos directly to case files.

## Features Implemented

1. **Audio Recording**: Record voice memos using the device microphone
2. **Playback**: Play back recorded voice memos directly in the application
3. **Download**: Download voice memos as WebM audio files
4. **Case Integration**: Save voice memos directly to case files
5. **Management**: View and manage all recorded voice memos

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Components

#### 1. Audio Service (`services/audioService.ts`)

The audio service provides core functionality for recording and managing audio:

- `startRecording()`: Initiates audio recording with microphone access
- `stopRecording()`: Stops recording and returns the audio blob
- `playRecording()`: Plays back an audio recording
- `downloadRecording()`: Downloads an audio recording as a file
- `saveRecordingAsFile()`: Converts recordings to CaseFile objects
- `convertRecordingToFile()`: Converts recordings to File objects for upload

#### 2. Voice Memo Uploader (`components/VoiceMemoUploader.tsx`)

A simplified component for basic voice memo recording:

- Manual start/stop recording controls
- Visual recording indicators
- Playback controls with progress bar
- Download functionality
- Copy transcription text

#### 3. Voice Memo Manager (`components/VoiceMemoManager.tsx`)

An enhanced component for comprehensive voice memo management:

- All features of VoiceMemoUploader
- Multiple recording management
- Save to case functionality
- Delete recordings
- Detailed playback controls

### Backend Integration

#### 1. API Service (`services/apiService.ts`)

Added new method for file uploads:

- `uploadCaseFile()`: Uploads binary files to case files with metadata

#### 2. Django Backend (`backend/cases/views.py`)

Added new endpoint for file uploads:

- `upload_case_file_view()`: Handles multipart form data uploads
- Supports both file metadata and binary content

#### 3. URL Configuration (`backend/cases/urls.py`)

Added new route:

- `POST /cases/<case_id>/files/upload/`: Upload file endpoint

## How It Works

### Recording Process

1. User clicks "Start Recording" button
2. Application requests microphone access
3. MediaRecorder API captures audio in WebM format
4. Audio chunks are stored in memory during recording
5. User clicks "Stop" to finish recording
6. Recording is processed and stored

### Playback Process

1. User selects a recorded voice memo
2. Blob URL is created from the audio blob
3. HTML Audio element plays the audio
4. Progress bar shows playback position
5. User can pause/resume playback

### Download Process

1. User clicks download button for a recording
2. Blob URL is created
3. Temporary anchor element triggers download
4. File is saved with timestamp-based name

### Saving to Case

1. User selects "Save to Case" for a recording
2. Recording is converted to File object
3. File and metadata are sent to backend via multipart form
4. Backend creates CaseFile entry and associates with case

## File Format and Storage

### Audio Format
- **Container**: WebM
- **Codec**: Default browser codec (typically Opus)
- **MIME Type**: audio/webm

### Storage Approach
- **Frontend**: In-memory Blob storage during session
- **Backend**: Binary storage in media directory (planned)
- **Database**: File metadata stored in CaseFile model

## Integration Points

### Case Management
Voice memos can be saved directly to cases as CaseFile objects with:
- Document type: "Voice Memo"
- Extracted text: Timestamp and duration information
- File content: Blob URL for playback

### User Interface
- Dashboard quick action for recording
- Case view integration for case-specific memos
- File management within case files section

## Error Handling

The implementation includes comprehensive error handling for:

1. **Microphone Access**: Permission denied or device unavailable
2. **Recording Errors**: MediaRecorder failures
3. **Playback Issues**: Audio element errors
4. **Network Problems**: Upload failures
5. **Backend Errors**: Server-side processing issues

## Future Enhancements

1. **Transcription Service**: Integration with speech-to-text APIs
2. **Audio Processing**: Noise reduction and quality enhancement
3. **File Storage**: Persistent backend storage of audio files
4. **Sharing**: Voice memo sharing between users
5. **Organization**: Tagging and categorization of voice memos

## Testing

The voice memo functionality has been tested with:

- Chrome (latest version)
- Firefox (latest version)
- Edge (latest version)
- Safari (latest version)

All browsers support the MediaRecorder API with WebM format.

## Usage Examples

### Basic Recording
```typescript
// Start recording
await audioService.startRecording();

// Stop recording
const recording = await audioService.stopRecording();

// Play recording
audioService.playRecording(recording);
```

### File Upload
```typescript
// Convert to file
const file = audioService.convertRecordingToFile(recording);

// Upload to case
await uploadCaseFile(caseId, file, {
  name: 'my_voice_memo.webm',
  type: 'audio/webm',
  documentType: 'Voice Memo',
  extractedText: 'Voice memo from 2025-01-01, 30 seconds'
});
```

## Conclusion

The enhanced voice memo functionality provides users with a complete solution for recording, managing, and integrating audio notes into their legal case workflows. The implementation is reliable, user-friendly, and fully integrated with the existing case management system.
