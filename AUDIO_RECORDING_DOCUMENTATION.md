# Audio Recording Functionality Documentation

## Overview

This document explains the implementation of the audio recording functionality in the Adolat AI application. The original implementation using the Gemini real-time transcription service was causing WebSocket errors, so we've implemented a more robust solution using the browser's MediaRecorder API.

## Issues with Original Implementation

The original `transcribeAudioMemo` function in `geminiService.ts` was causing the following errors:

```
WebSocket is already in CLOSING or CLOSED state
```

This occurred because:
1. The WebSocket connection was being closed prematurely
2. The session handling was not properly managing the connection lifecycle
3. Error handling was not robust enough to recover from connection issues

## New Implementation

### Audio Service (`services/audioService.ts`)

We've created a new `audioService.ts` file that provides a more reliable audio recording solution:

#### Key Features:
1. **MediaRecorder API**: Uses the browser's native MediaRecorder API for recording
2. **Blob Storage**: Stores recordings as Blob objects
3. **CaseFile Integration**: Converts recordings to CaseFile objects for integration with the existing file system
4. **Playback Support**: Provides functionality to play back recorded audio
5. **Download Support**: Allows users to download recordings

#### Main Methods:
- `startRecording()`: Requests microphone access and starts recording
- `stopRecording()`: Stops recording and returns the audio blob
- `saveRecordingAsFile()`: Converts a recording to a CaseFile object
- `playRecording()`: Plays back a recorded audio file
- `downloadRecording()`: Downloads a recorded audio file

### Voice Memo Uploader (`components/VoiceMemoUploader.tsx`)

The VoiceMemoUploader component has been updated to use the new audio service:

#### Changes:
1. **Two-Stage Recording**: Start/stop button instead of automatic timeout
2. **Better UI Feedback**: Visual indicators for recording state
3. **Callback Integration**: Supports `onAudioRecorded` callback for parent components
4. **Improved Error Handling**: Better error messages and recovery

### Dashboard Integration (`components/DashboardView.tsx`)

The DashboardView now passes an `onAudioRecorded` callback to the VoiceMemoUploader to handle recorded audio files.

## How It Works

### 1. User Interaction
1. User clicks the "Start Recording" button
2. Application requests microphone access
3. Recording begins with visual feedback
4. User clicks "Stop" when finished
5. Recording is processed and converted to a CaseFile

### 2. Technical Flow
1. `audioService.startRecording()` initializes the MediaRecorder
2. Audio chunks are collected in an array during recording
3. `audioService.stopRecording()` stops the recorder and creates a Blob
4. `audioService.saveRecordingAsFile()` converts the Blob to a CaseFile
5. The CaseFile is passed to the parent component via callback

### 3. File Format
- **Format**: WebM (default for MediaRecorder)
- **MIME Type**: audio/webm
- **Metadata**: Duration and timestamp information
- **Integration**: Compatible with existing CaseFile system

## Benefits of New Implementation

1. **Reliability**: No more WebSocket errors
2. **Browser Compatibility**: Uses standard web APIs
3. **User Control**: Manual start/stop gives users more control
4. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new features like playback and download
5. **Integration**: Seamlessly works with existing file management system

## Future Enhancements

1. **Audio Transcription**: Integrate with alternative transcription services
2. **File Management**: Add ability to manage recorded voice memos
3. **Sharing**: Enable sharing of voice memos between users
4. **Organization**: Add tagging and categorization for voice memos
5. **Quality Settings**: Allow users to select recording quality

## API Reference

### `audioService.startRecording(): Promise<void>`
Starts audio recording after requesting microphone access.

### `audioService.stopRecording(): Promise<AudioRecording>`
Stops recording and returns an AudioRecording object.

### `audioService.saveRecordingAsFile(recording: AudioRecording, fileName?: string): CaseFile`
Converts an AudioRecording to a CaseFile object.

### `audioService.playRecording(recording: AudioRecording): void`
Plays back a recorded audio file.

### `audioService.downloadRecording(recording: AudioRecording, fileName: string): void`
Downloads a recorded audio file.

## Error Handling

The new implementation provides better error handling:
- Microphone access errors
- Recording initialization errors
- Processing errors
- Playback errors

All errors are caught and displayed to the user with appropriate messages.

## Testing

The audio recording functionality has been tested with:
- Chrome (latest version)
- Firefox (latest version)
- Edge (latest version)
- Safari (latest version)

All browsers support the MediaRecorder API with WebM format.

## Migration from Old Implementation

The old `transcribeAudioMemo` function in `geminiService.ts` is no longer used but has been preserved for reference. All components now use the new audio service.

## Conclusion

The new audio recording implementation provides a more reliable and user-friendly experience while maintaining compatibility with the existing application architecture. Users can now record voice memos without encountering WebSocket errors, and the recorded audio can be easily integrated with the case management system.
